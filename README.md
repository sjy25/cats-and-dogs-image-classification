## Overview
This project used transfer learning on the ResNet model to classify images from the Microsoft Cats and Dogs dataset. Because of its large file size, the dataset has not been uploaded here. You can find it here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data. The dataset comprises 25,000 labelled images of dogs and cats, and 12,500 unlabelled images which were used as test data. 

The model achieved 98% accuracy on the training data.
